1) In C#, how do you implement the singleton design pattern?
* Singleton design pattern in c# is one of the most popular design patterns.In this pattern, a class has only one instance in the program that provides a global point of access to it. in other words, a singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and usually gives simple access to that instance.

2) Distinction between CType and Conversion.
* By "conversion" I mean converting one datatype to another (e.g string to interger,decimal to integer,object to string)

* By "cast" I mean changing one type of object into another type that is related to it by one of the following rules

*) CType is capable of a "cast" or a "conversion". DirectCast can only "cast".

3) Is C# code managed or unmanaged code?
 * Managed code is code that runs within the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in the .NET environment. When we write code in languages like c#,VB.NEt, Or f# it is compiled into Intermediate Language (IL). This IL code is executed by the CLR, which provides service such as garbage collection, exception handling, and memory management.
 
 4) What is console application?
 * Console application are extremely useful in software development and system administration. These are program designed to operate within a text-only interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or termianl. Unlike graphical user interface (GUI) applications, which depend on visual components like windows,button, and icons, console application interact with users through text input and output.
 
 5) What is C# Namespaces?
 * Namespaces are used to organize the classes. it helps to control the scope of method and classes in larger. Net Programming projects.
 
 * The biggest advantages of using namesapce is that the class names which are declared in one namespace will not clash with the same class names declared in another namespace.
 
 6) What is tuple in C#?
 * A Tuple is a data structure which consists of multiple parts. It is the easiest way to represent a data set which has multiple values of different types. it allows us to create,manipulate, and access data sets. we can add elements from 1 to 8.
 if try to add element greater than eight, then the compiler will throw error.
 
 7)What is Events?
 * An event is a notification sent by an object to signal the occurrence of an action, Events in .NET follw the observer 			 design pattern.
 
* The class who raises events is called Publisher, and the class who receives the notification is called Subscriber. There can be multiple subscribers of a single event.   
  
 * Typicaaly , a publisher raises an event when some action occured. The subscribers, who are interested in getting a notification when an action occured, should register with an event and handle it.
 
 8) What is constructor chaining?
 * Constructor chaining is a technique in C# that allows one constructor to call another constructor of the same class or a base class. It can help simplify the initialization of objects and avoid code duplication. However, it also has some potential drawbacks that you should be aware of.
 
 9) What is a multicasting delegate in C#?
 * One method reference, which is encapsulated in the delegate, is the only one that it is possible for the delegate to call. These Delegate to call. These Delegates are known as Multicast Delegates because they have the capacity to hold and invoke multiple methods.
 
 10) What is Access Modifiers?
 * Access Modifiers are keyword that define the accessibility of a member, class or datatype in progarm. These are mainly used to restrict unwanted data manipulation by external programs or classes. These Modifiers control the scope and extent of access to classes, methods, properties,and other members within and from external classes or assemblies.
 
 11) What is a Virtual Method in C#?
 * In C#, a virtual method is a method that can be overridden in a derived class. When a method is declared as virtual in a base class, it allows a derived class to provide its own implementation of the method.
 
 12) What is c# Multithreading?
 * Multithreading in c# is a programming technique that allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process.
 Each thread represents a separate execution path, enabling tasks to be performed in parallel, improving the efficiency and performance of application.
 
 13) What is HashTable?
 * In C#, a Hashtable is a collection that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash code to organize the keys for efficient data retrieval. The key can be any object, and each key is associcated with a corresponding value. It is a part of the System.Collections namespace and is non-generic ( which means it can store any kind of object as both the key and value).
 
 14) What is LINQ?
 * LINQ is known as Language Integrated Query and it is introduced in .NET 3.5 and VS 2208. It is used to generate queries to retrieve data from the data source.For example, a Program may get information from the student records or accessing employee records, etc . In Past Years, such type of data is stored in a separate database from the application, and you need to learn different types of query language to access such type of data like SQL,XML,etc.  To overcome such type of problems Microsoft developed LINQ. It attaches one, more power to the C# or .NET langauges to generate a query for any LINQ compatible data Source.
 
 15) What is File Handling in C#?
 * The term File Handling refers to the various operations like creating the file, reading from the file, writing to the file, appending the file, etc. There are two basic operation which is mostly used in file handling is reading and writing of the file. The file become stream when we open the file for writing and reading.A stream is a sequence of bytes which is used for communication.Two stream can be formed from file one is input stream which is used to read the file and another is output stream is used to write in the file.
 
 16) What do you understand about Get and Set Accessor properties?
 * In C3, Get and Set are termed accessors because they use properties. Such private fileds are accessed via accessors.
 It is very essential to restrict the accessibility of the property.
 
 17) What is the Race condition in C#?
 * When 2 threads access the same resource and try to change it at the same time, we have a race condition.
 
 18) Why are Async and Await used in C#?
 * Async and Await are the two keywords that help us to program asynchronouly. An async keyword is a method that performs asynchronous tasks such as fetching data from database, reading a file,they can be marked as "async". Whereas await keyword making :await" to a statement means suspending the execution of the async method it is residing in until the asynchronous task completes.
 
 19) What is Thread Pooling in C#?
* In C#, a Thread Pool is a group of threads. These threads are used to do work without interfering with the principal thread's operation.

20) What information can you provide regarding the XSD file in c#?
XSD stands for XML Scheme Definition. The XML file can have any attributes and elements if there is no XSD file associated with it.

21) What information can you provide regarding the XSD file in C#?
* In C#, an XSD (XML Scheme Definition) file defines the structure and data types of XML documents, allowing for validation and ensuring XML data conforms to specific rules. You can use tools like xsd.exe to generate XSD file from XML or c# classes, and then use c# classes to interact with the XSD.

22) What are I/O classes in C#? 
In c#, the System.IO namespace contains multiple classes that are used to conduct different file operations such as creation, deletion, closure, and opening.

23) What exactly do you mean by regular expressions in C#? 
A Regular expression is a pattern that can be used to match a set of input, Constructs, character literals, and operations are all possible.
